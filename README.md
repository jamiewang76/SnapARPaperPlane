## Inspiration
We were inspired by the passing-secret-notes game we play as kids in elementary school classrooms. We would toss the anonymous notes with secrets, love confessions, or jokes to other kids and the anonymity of the game makes it more realistic as we could never predict if the notes are passed to the "target receiver". 

## What it does
Paper Plane AR lens gives all users the fun of passing-secret-notes while remaining anonymous, you can tell your secret while observing others' emotions as they might become the receiver of your secrets! Users who join the session can send messages written on paper planes to a random player in the game.  This game is best used at parties held either in-person or online. Let your imagination take off and bring the party on!

## How we built it
We utilized the sync framework to sync the messages with all the players in the session. The message has a receiver randomly determined by the system and only the receiver can view the message.

## Challenges we ran into
The sync framework was at first a strange and complex system for us to learn, but we managed to figure it out by manipulating and tinkering with the provided template.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The game we built is compact but could be super fun to play with. We managed to carry out our initial conception and ship it within a very short time frame.

## What we learned
Never give up learning. Frustration and failure are the paths to success!

## What's next for Paper Plane
We hope this game would be enjoyed by everyone. Bring the party on!
